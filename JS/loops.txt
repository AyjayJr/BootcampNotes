== LOOPS ==
Basics
---
Loops allow us to repeat code.
There are multiple types of loops:
- For loop
- While loop
- For...of loop
- For...in loop

For Loops
---
For loop syntax is the same as normal.
e.g. for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {}.
Good for iterating over arrays.

Nested Loops
---
We know how to nest loops.
They are good for traversing multi dimensional arrays.

While Loop
---
Same syntax as I'm used to.
While loop are useful for when you are not sure how many times you have to loop.

Break Keyword
---
Breaks out of loops.

For...of Loop
---
Nice and easy way to iterate over arrays, not supported by IE.
Syntax is:
for (let variableName of iterable object) {}
Good to use when you don't care about the value of i when iterating.
Most commonly used with arrays but can be used for other iterable objects.
Cannot be used to iterate over object literals.

For...in Loop
---
Same syntax as for...of loop except uses in keyword.
Used to iterate over object literals but will only give you the keys.
Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries() will give you object keys/values.
Using the above methods with a for...of loop can get you the functionality u want.
