== Primitives Types ==
JavaScript data types:
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol
- BigInt

Numbers
---
JS has only one number type.
Numbers only have a limited number of memory space.
JS has a number of math operations inlcuding:
- Addition '+'
- Subtraction '-'
- Multiplication '*'
- Division '/'
- Modulo '%'
- Exponentiaion '**' (raises a the first number to the power of the second)
e.g. 2 ** 4 evaluates to 16
Arithmetic follows PEMDAS rule for evaluation.
NaN is part of the number type that represents something that is not a number.

Variables
---
Give a name to a value and store it to be used later.
Basic variable declaration involves the keyword "let".
e.g. let year = 1996
JS is dynamically typed so all data types use "let" keyword.
"const" keyword works just like let but the value cannot be changed.
"var" is the old way to declare variables, these days it isn't really useful.
JS naming convention is camelCase.

Booleans
---
Booleans are used to store a true or false value;
We use the keywords "true" and "false" for values;

Null
---
Intentional absence of any value.
Must be defined by developer.

Undefined
---
Variables that do not have an assigned value.

Math Object
---
A collection of properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.
