== DOM Events ==
Responding to user inputs and actions such as:
- clicks
- drags
- hovers
- scrolls
- etc.

Inline Events
---
You can add a property directly to your html element through attributes.
Attributes such as onclick, onkeyup, etc. will create event handlers.
Not a great approach.

JS Properties
---
In javaScript you can select an html element and add handlers that way.
Similar to how you are able to change attributes from javaScript.
Set onproperty to a function/arrow function.
Better but still not ideal.
Does not allow for multple callback functions on the same property.

Event Listener
---
addEventListener() takes two arguments, what event to listen for followed by
a function to execute when that event occurs.
This will allow us to use multiple different callbacks for a single event.
