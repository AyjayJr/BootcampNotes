== DOM Events ==
Responding to user inputs and actions such as:
- clicks
- drags
- hovers
- scrolls
- etc.

Inline Events
---
You can add a property directly to your html element through attributes.
Attributes such as onclick, onkeyup, etc. will create event handlers.
Not a great approach.

JS Properties
---
In javaScript you can select an html element and add handlers that way.
Similar to how you are able to change attributes from javaScript.
Set onproperty to a function/arrow function.
Better but still not ideal.
Does not allow for multple callback functions on the same property.

Event Listener
---
addEventListener() takes two arguments, what event to listen for followed by
a function to execute when that event occurs.
This will allow us to use multiple different callbacks for a single event.

This Keyword
---
You can use the keyword this to create general functionality for eventlisteners.
This will refer to the element that evoked the callback function from an event.
This can be used to duplicate functionality for different types of elements.

Event Object and Keyboard Event
---
The event object contains information about how and where an event was evoked.
This object is automatically passed to event handler callback functions.
This is important for Keyboard events bc it will contain information about which 
key was pressed and we usually want that for keyboard events.
Keycode and key in the event object contain the information about what key was
pressed.
To access these you must capture e or evt in the arguments of your callback.
Then use e.key or e.keyCode.
Key gives information about what character was generated.
KeyCode gives information about what key on the keyboard was pressed.

Form Events
---
The default action for forms is to submit and request.
We can listen for this submit and changed the default behavior.
Think about adding a comment to a page, the form is not submitted elsewhere rather
it changes something about the page that you're currently on.
On the event object there is a method called preventDefault().
This will stop the default form behavior from occurring.
To select and recieve input from a form each form object has an elements properties
which will contain the names of all the input fields.
e.g. form.elements.username will retrieve the username object from the form.
The elements object is iterable and stores each input in order and by name attr.
Furthermore adding a .value to the end will get you whatever value was entered
into the form.

Change/Input Events
---
Change event will only fire when you you click away from an input and it is
different than it was before.
This is counterintuitive to it's name because it doesn't update live changes.
Input event fires whenever a value is added to the input.
e.g. typed or copy pasted characters.
Avoid using keyup or keydown because it doesn't fire w copy/paste or talk to text
and it also considers keys that don't modify the input value e.g. arrows/shift.
