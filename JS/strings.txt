Strings
---
Strings represent words and must be wrapped in quotations.
Can use either single or double quotes but cannot mix the two.
Use backslash '\' to escape special characters.
Strings are indexed like arrays.
String[n] will get the nth index of String.
You can use '+' operator to concatenate a string.
When doing concatenation between a number and a string JS will try to make them
a common type.

String Methods
---
Methods are built in actions that we can perform on strings.
Examples are:
- Search within string.
- Replacing part of a string.
- Changing the casing of a string.
Syntax is thing.method().
A non-destructive method doesn't change the original string.
It's possible to chain multiple methods together.

Methods w Arguments
---
Some methods require arguments to function.
Examples are:
- indexOf(arg)
- searchFor(arg)

String Template Literals
---
Allows you to create a string with embedded expressions.
e.g. `I counted ${3 + 4} sheep.` > I counted 7 sheep.
For this to work you must use the backtick character not single quotes!
Useful for embedding variables in strings.
