== Comparison Operators ==

Gt,Lt,Gtoe,Ltoe
---
These return either true or false values.
Greater than(>), Less than(<), Greater or equal to(>=), Less than or equal to(<=).

Equality
---
Double equals (==) checks for equality of value but not of type.
When using double equals with different types you may get some unexpected results.
Triple equals (===) checks for equality of value and type.
Not equal (!=) functions similar to double equals where it doesn't care about type.
Strict not equal (!==) cares about type.
As a rule of thumb always use triple equals when comparing something.

== Conditional Statements ==

If Statement
---
Only runs code if a given condition is true.
e.g. If (rating == 3) {}

Else if/ Else
---
We know how these work.

Truthy/Falsy
---
Falsy values:
- false
- 0
- "" (empty string)
- null
- undefined
- NaN
All other values are truthy.
When using conditionals with falsy values they will be treated as false.

Logical Operators
---
AND, OR, NOT
&&, ||, !
