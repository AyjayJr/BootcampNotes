== NPM and Modules ==
Modules are basically libraries of code like in other languages.
To include a module you must require it.
In order for one script to read another scripts methods you must use
module.exports.
Module.exports is an object that methods can be attached to for use in 
another script.
Only methods that are exported will be visible to other scripts.
You can use exports in place of module.exports for shorter syntax.

NPM
---
Massive library of packages that other people have written.
A command line tool to install and manage those packages.
The command npm i ${packageName} will install packages.
This command will install a module locally in the folder specified.
It's possible to install things globally by adding -g flag.
This is usually done for command line tools.

Package.json
---
This is a special file in every node app that contains metadata.
One of the most important bits of info in here are the dependencies.
You need to install all these dependencies to use the initial program.
Usually you will create this file with an NPM command, npm init.
Init will walk you through creating a package.json file.
Now when a module is installed in the same folder it will automatically
be added to the dependencies list.

Installing Dependencies
---
Running npm install in a folder with a package.json will automatically
install all the dependencies.
This will create a node_modules directory for you.
This is a very common workflow.
