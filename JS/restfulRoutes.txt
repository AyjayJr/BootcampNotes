== RESTful Routing ==

Get vs. Post
---
Get requests:
- Used to retrieve info
- Data sent via query string (text)
- Info visibile in URL
- Limited by characters allowed in URL
Post Requests:
- Used to post data to server
- Used to write/create/update
- Data sent via request body
- Can send any data (JSON)

Express Post Routes
---
Post data is stored in the req.body.
By default body in undefined, requires middleware to handle.
You must tell express to parse URL data wtih the following line:
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
To parse JSON data use the following line:
app.use(express.json());

REST
---
Representational State Transfer, an architectural style.
A set of guidelines on how clients and servers should communicate.
Treating data on server side as resources that can be CRUDed.
CRUD = Create Read Update Destroy.
Client and server are separated.
Uniform interface that consists of a consistent URL pattern matched with
different HTTP verbs.
