== Scope ==
Can be thought of as variable visibilty.
The location where a variable is defined dictates where it can be accessed.

Function Scope
---
Variables defined in a function with let cannot be accessed outside the function.
If two variables have the same name the variable with the closest scope wins.

Block Scope
---
A block is anytime you see curly braces that are not a function.
e.g. conditionals and loops
Variables defined within blocks with let/const keyword are scoped to the block.
If you use var keyword variables are scoped to the function but not the block.

Lexical Scope
---
An inner function nested within some parent function has access to the variables defined within the scope of the parent function.
