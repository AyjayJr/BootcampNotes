Templating
---
Defines patterns a webpage that we can dynamically modify.
For example a search template that gives different results each time.
Ability to add loops and conditional logic to html pages.
Many templating languages to choose from.
e.g. Jade, Pug, Nunjucks, Ejs

# Most templating notes are done in templatePractice code

EJS
---
A templating language very similar to javascript.
EJS allows for dynamic content within html files.
EJS contains its own special open and closing tags to denote content.

Basic EJS Syntax
---
These tags indicate to ejs that the following content is not html.
Each get evaluated differently.
<% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
<%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
<%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
<%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
<%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
<%% Outputs a literal '<%'
%> Plain ending tag
-%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
_%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it

Passing Data
---
Usually dynamic content is some sort of data retrieved from a database.
Generally we don't want much logic within the templates.
First do logic in the js file and then pass it to the template as an object.
Very common for parsing api data and embedding into page.

Conditionals
---
Must use <% tag.
This creates a conditional statement with no output.
It will display HTML only when the conditional is true.
We can use loops to iterate a bunch of similar content.
