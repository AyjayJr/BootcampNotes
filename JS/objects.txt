Basics
---
Objects are collections of properties.
Properties are key-value pairs.
Rather than accessing data using an index, we use custom keys.
e.g.
const fitBitData = {
  totalSteps       : 308727,
  totalMiles       : 211.7,
  avgCalorieBurn   : 5775,
  workoutsThisWeek : '5 of 7',
  avgGoodSleep     : '2:13'
};

Accessing Data
---
To access data use square brackets and quotes for the key with the value you want.
e.g. fitBitData['totalSteps'] will return 308727.
You can also use a dot to access the key.
e.g. fitBitData.totalSteps will also return 308727.
Important to know that all valid keys are converted to strings.
When using a variable you need to use square brackets.
e.g. let birthYear = 1999;
     years[birthYear] will evaluate to years['1999']
     * the same cannot be done with the dot syntax. *
To modify the value of a key just access and set to something different.
e.g. fitBitData.totalSteps = 500000;

Arrays + Objects
---
It's possible to nest objects within arrays
Also possible to nest objects within other objects.
