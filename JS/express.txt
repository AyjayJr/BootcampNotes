== Express ==
Express is a miniamlist web framework for Node
It's just an npm package that we install that helps bulid webapps.
Express helps us:
- Start up server to listen for http requests
- Parse incoming requests
- Match those requests to particular routes
- Craft our http response and associated content
A library is code written by others that you decide where you want to 
incorporate it into your code.
A framework tells you where to plug in your code and takes control of 
most of the aspects of development.
Express is very close to a library in how much control it leaves in the 
hands of the developer.
