== Express ==
Express is a miniamlist web framework for Node
It's just an npm package that we install that helps bulid webapps.
Express helps us:
- Start up server to listen for http requests
- Parse incoming requests
- Match those requests to particular routes
- Craft our http response and associated content
A library is code written by others that you decide where you want to 
incorporate it into your code.
A framework tells you where to plug in your code and takes control of 
most of the aspects of development.
Express is very close to a library in how much control it leaves in the 
hands of the developer.

Routing
---
Common term that refers to taking incoming requests and matching
that to some code and some response.
Matches the url path to some response page.
We have only been exposed to exact match paths.
Sometimes we want to respond to some pattern in a path.
We use a colon to specify a variable in express. 
e.g. reddit.com/r/:subredditname
Express adds a property to the request object called params.
Params contains a property named subreddit and the value is set to
whatever string is passed in the url in that pattern.

Query Strings
---
The request object that express creates stores info about they query string.
This can be accessed and used in our code.
