== Ajax and APIs ==
AJAX stands for: 
- Asynchronous 
- JavaScript
- And
- XML
It refers to making requests behind the scenes after the page has already been loaded.
When we are making requests with JavaScript we are usually just looking for data.
Even though the X stands for XML we almost always use JSON.

API stands for:
- Application
- Programming 
- Interface 
A broad term that refers to an interface that allows one piece of software to interact
with another piece of software.
A web API is an API that is web based.
They are end points left exposed to respond to requests with information for software to consume.


JSON
---
Stands for:
- Java
- Script
- Object
- Notation
A way of format for data that is consistent and predictable.
Based on JavaScript objects and object notation.
Has Key and Value pairs.
You can parse JSON in other languages like python/ruby. 
JavaScript has a built-in function to turn JSON into valid JavaScript, JSON.parse().
To turn a JS object into valid JSON use JSON.stringify().

Postman
---
Postman is a tool for making API requests.
When you send requests you recieve a body which is the data we requested.
We also get headers which is basically the metadata for the request.
Also we get status codes, which are just quick indicators of if the request was good/bad.
Any code starting with 2 is a successful code.
Any code starting with 3 is a redirect code.
Any code starting with 4 is a client side error code.
Any code starting with 5 is a server side error code.
