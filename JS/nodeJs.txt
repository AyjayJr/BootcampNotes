== Node JS ==
Node is a JavaScript runtime that executes code outside of the browser.
Allows us to use JS syntax to write server-side code.

Uses
---
Uses for Node are the following,
- web servers
- command line toold
- native apps (vscode/slack are written with node)
- video games (crosscode)

Differences
---
Since node is not run in the browser we don't have access to all the
browser stuff.
e.g. window, document, and DOM APIs
Node instead includes many features that don't exist in the browser.
These modules help us interact with the OS and files/folders.

Running files
---
Create scripts in a .js file.
Run scripts by typing node {filename}.
Typing node on its own opens a REPL.

Process and Argv
---
Process is an object in the global scope that provides information about,
and control over, the current nodejs process.
This includes the version of node, as well as methods for i/o to console.
process.argv returns an array of the command line arguments passed when 
the nodejs process was launched.

File System Module
---
fs is the name of the file system module.
Many of the fs methods come in both sync and async forms.
Rememeber sync means that it will halt all computation until a response
is recieved.
Async will allow the code to continue running and will run code depending
on whether or not the response was resolved or rejected.
FS is not a thing by defaullt, we must first require it.
e.g. const fs = require('fs');
This module contains methods that handle file creations/deletions etc.
