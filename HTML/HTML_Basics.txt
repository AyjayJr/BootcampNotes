Misc HTML Notes
===============

Intro
  - <p> tags and <b> tags
  - Basics of tags
  - Use mdn for list of all tags


Headings
  - Have at most 1 <h1> on your page
  - Don't use deeper level headings <h2 - h6> for smaller font size
  - Don't have an <h3> without an <h2>
  - Use smaller headings to show similar levels of nesting between elements

HTML Boilerplate
  - Standardized markup that all pages need
  - <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
        </head>

        </body>

  - <title> changes name displayed in the tag and google uses it
  - <body> all of the content of the document
