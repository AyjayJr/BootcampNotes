HTML Next Steps and Semantics
=============================

What is HTML5
- The latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML
- A standardized document describing how elements work
- DOCTYPE is used to flag that you are using the latest version

Block vs. Inline
- Inline elements fit in alongside other elements e.g. span
  - span used to single out certain elements for styling 
    - doesn't take up a block of content
- Block level elements take up a whole block of space e.g. div
  - div is used to group content together

Assortment of Elements
- <hr> creates a border between content (horizontal rule)
- <br> create a line break
- <sup> superscript (inline)
- <sub> subscript (inline)
- <pre> preformatted, reserves spaces and line breaks

HTML Entities 
- Start with ampersand and end with a semicolon
- Used to display special characters (e.g. copytight, trademark, etc.)
- Browser interprets and renders the correct character instead
- Some characters are vital to the syntax of HTML and therefore must use
  entitiy codes to display them. (e.g. angled brackets, ampersand, etc.)

Semantic Markup
- Using elements that indicate purpose of elements
- Instead of using all divs use things such as:
    + header (header section of page)
    + section (standalone section of a website)
    + nav (navigational items)
    + article
    + footer
    + main (dominant content that is repeated across pages)
    + summary
    + details
    + aside (sidebars, callout boxes)
    + time (should specify datetime attribute for machine readable time)
    + figure (image or illustration often grouped with a caption)
  to give meaning to your elements
