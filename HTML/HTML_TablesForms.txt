Tables & Forms
==============

Tables
---

Tables can be used to display data in a tabular format
Many elements that go into making a table

tr, td, and th elements
- td (table data) what goes into the table
- tr (table row) nest around td's to signify which row they belong to  
- th (defines header) headers need to be in their own row

thead, tfoot, tbody elements
- Don't do much other than break up table into logical sections
- Wrap thead around your row of headers
- wrap tbody around your main data
- tfooter is rarely used but can be used when you have totals
  or averages at the bottom of the data table.
- Good for accessibility purposes

colspan, rowspan
- attribute for table elements to allow data to span columns or rows

Forms
---

The <form> element represents a section with interactive controls
We fill a form with a collection of inputs, checkboxes, buttons, etc.

form attributes
- "action" attribute specifies where the form data should be sent
- "method" attribute specifies which HTTP method should be used

input element
- no closing tags on input
- input can be used to create a variety of different form controls
- "type" attribute dramatically alters the input's behavior and appearance
- "placeholder" attribute is text shown in input before you start typing

labels
- very important for accesibility of your forms
- associates text with an input behind the scenes
- to link label and input use the "for" attr and "id" attr
  e.g.  <label for="cheese"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="cheese">

buttons
- unless otherwise explicitly stated, a button within a form will submit the form
- "type" attribute as submit will submit forms
- if you don't want to submit then set the type attribute to button

name attribute
- used to send the data to the server as a pair
- pretty much like a variable to signify the type of data
- put name on every input that you use

radio buttons
- input type "radio"
- associate group of radio buttons by giving them all the same "name" attribute
- use "value" attribute to determine what value is sent to the server
- value and id attr should be different from name attr

<select> menu
- dropdown menu of items
- must have child option elements
- each option element should have a different value attribute

range & textarea
- when exact value is not neccessary (range slider)
- can add step to determine how many steps the range is divided into
- textarea is a multi line text input
  + rows and cols attributes to control size
  + placeholder to add placeholder

form validations
- makes sure that the data provided in the forms meets the expectations
- simple client validation is adding "required" attribute to input element
- minlength/maxlength attributes also add some form of validation to text inputs
- min/max attributes add range to numerical inputs
- pattern attribute uses regex to determine if the input matches the
  pattern definied by the regex expression
