== The CSS Cascade ==
The order that your styles are declared in and linked to matter.
The last style declared is the winner.
This also applies to if you have multiple stylesheets, the styles in the last one linked
override styles in earlier linked sheets.

== Specificity ==
Specificity is how the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply
to the same element.
It is a measure of how specific a given selector is. The more specific one wins.
Generally the order of specificity goes ID > Class > Element.
IDs will beat Classes and Classes will beat Elements.
Inline styles will beat all other styles, not reccomended.
Style declarations can be declared !important to beat all others, also not reccomended.

== Inheritance ==
Some CSS properties will be inherited by child elements.
Some elements don't inherit things by default, use inherit keyword to force inheritance.
