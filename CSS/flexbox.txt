== Flex Box ==
Basics
---
To activate flexbox set display property to flex on container element.

Flex Model
---
Two axes in a flexbox, main and cross.
By default the main axis is horizontal and the cross is vertical.

Flex-direction
---
This property is used to change the main and cross axes.
- Row is set by default where main axis is horizontal (going from left to right) and cross vertical.
- Row-reverse is the same axes as row, but the items will start from right to left.
- Column will swap the axes (e.g. main=vertical, cross=horizontal), and go from top to bottom.
- Column-reverse has the same axes as column, but will go from bottom to top.

Justify-content
---
Determines how the content is distributed across the main axis.
- Flex-start will move content to the start of the main axis.
- Flex-end will move the content to the end of the main axis.
- Center will move content to the center of the main axis.
- Space-between will distribute all extra space between the elements but not on the outside edges.
- Space-around will distribute all extra space around each element.
- Space-evenly distributes space evenly between all elements and the elements and the container.
Note that all these rules are dependant on what flex direction is set to.

Flex-wrap
---
Determines whether elements are going to wrap along the main axis onto a new line/column.
Only two keywords you need to know:
- Wrap will wrap from left to right if cross=horizontal and top to bottom if cross=vertical.
- Wrap-reverse will wrap from right to left if cross=horizontal and bottom to top if cross=vertical.

Align-items
---
Determines how to distribute space along the cross axis.
- Flex-start will align content at the beginning of the cross axis. (Default)
- Flex-end will align content at the end of the cross axis.
- Center will align along the center of cross axis.
- Baseline will align content based on the baseline of text.

Align-content
---
Used to distribute space along the cross axis but only when there's multiple rows/columns.
Only works when flex-wrap is enabled.
Uses pretty much all the same keywords that we've seen before.
- Flex-start
- Flex-end
- Center
- Space-between
- Space-evenly
Align-self is used applied to single flex element to align itself along the cross axis.

Flex sizing properties
---
Flex-basis determines the intial size of an element, can be a width or height depending on flex direction.
Flex-grow determines how the elements will grow when there is extra space.
- Accepts a unitless number.
- Based on the proportions of the available space that you want to be taken up by an item.
Flex-shrink determines how the elements will shrink when there isn't enough available space
- Also accepts a unitless number
- Tells an element how fast to shrink relative to other elements.
Use min-width/max-width(or height depending on axes) to stop from growing/shring past a certain point.

Flex shorthand
---
Flex allows use to set all flex properties at once.
The order of the values is as follows:
- For 3 values, flex-grow / flex-shrink / flex-basis.
- For 2 unitless values, flex-grow / flex-shrink.
- For 2 values but one has a unit, flex-grow / flex-basis.
- For 1 unitlees value, flex-grow.
- For 1 value with unit, flex-basis.
