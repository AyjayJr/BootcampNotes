== Bootstrap Grid ==
Only works inside of a container.
Create a row by assigning a class of row to a div.
Each row has 12 units of space, 3 even columns = 4 unit each.
Each row can be separated into columns by creating a div with a class of col-#.
The # specifies how many units the element takes up on the row.
If the number is not specified the elements will automatically split space evenly.

If you add a size to col class it will only divide space after specified breakpoint.
i.e. if you have col-md-6, the element will span the full width until the medium breakpoint
and then it will take up 6 units of space.
You can also add more class names to specify how much space you want an element to
take up at different breakpoints.
e.g. class="col-md-6 col-lg-4", this will span the entire page until the medium
breakpoint where it will take up 6 units and then when it hits the large breakpoint
it will take up 4 units.

Alignment
---
Using flexbox properties you can align elements the same way you normally would
without having to use css.
Justify-content-start class will do what you expect.
Align-items-end class will do the same it does in flexbox.
This is just an easier way because all you have to do is add the class to the element
without having to write any actual css.
These also have the ability to distinguish between different screen sizes like the grid columns.
