== Responsive Design ==
Making a single website/app that can respond to multiple viewport widths
Media queries are used to achieve this.
Media queries allow us to modify stlyes depending on a screen width or device type.

== Media Queries ==
All media queries begin with @media(paramenters).
e.g. @media(min-width: 800px) {}
Min-width applies a style at a minimum of 800px and upwards.
Max-width applies a style at a maximim of 800px or less.
You can combine media queries with the 'and' keyword.
Orientation keyword can target landscape/portrait mode on mobile devices.
