== Width/Height ==
Controls the width/height of border-box.

== Border/Border Radius ==
Border-width controls the thickness of the border.
Border-style controls the line style (dashed, solid, etc).
Border-color controls the color of the border.
Border shorthand can be used to set all three at once.
Pixels are the most commonly used unit for borders.
Set box-sizing to border-box to account for border in width/height.
Border-radius is used to round the corners of your border.
Border-radius 50% will create a circle.

== Padding ==
The space between the content and the border.
Padding shorthand will set top right bottom left (clockwise).
You can also use two values to set vertical then horizontal.

== Margin ==
The space between two content boxes on the outside of the border.
Margin shorthand works the same way as padding shorthand.

== Display Property ==
Inline elements do not take up an entire line of space.
- Width and height are ignored for inline elements.
- Padding is respected horizontally but doesn't push content out of the way.
- Margin is respected horizontally but only on the line where the element sits.
Block elements push all other elements onto a new line.
Inline-Block elements behave like an inline element except width/height/margin are respected.
